# LocalLens API

A simple Node.js + Express API that lets you search for **local businesses** within a radius of a given location, filtered by category (restaurants, clothing, art, entertainment, miscellaneous).  

It uses **OpenStreetMapâ€™s Overpass API** as the data source (free, no API key required). Perfect for hackathons and prototypes.
